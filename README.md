Start your own imaginary esports team and manage them to become better players and win tournaments! Players are generated and have their own Elo which is their ranking on the competitive ladder. These players play games all the time and their Elo fluctates. Buying cheap players maybe risky since they are currently bad players but over time will become good players. Sometimes the good players are actually bad players in disguise and vice-versa. So it is important to observe the player market and analyze whether that player is good or not. Overtime the players will reach old age and will not be able to perform well in tournaments so it is important to get younger players. Older players can still be used to coach your team.
